# RCOM
Repository to host Computer Networks projects.

RCOM is a course given at FEUP in the third year of the Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering.

## Data Connection
The objective of this project was to implement a reliable data communication service between two systems connected through a serial port - RS-232.

## Computer Networks
In this project we developed a download application, following the file transfer protocol described in the [RFC 959](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc959.txt) and using URL syntax as described in the [RFC 1738](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt).

Therefore, this part of the project had as learning objectives:
* Describe client – server concept and its peculiarities in TCP/IP
* Characterize application protocols in general, characterize URL, describe in detail the behaviour of FTP
* Implement a simple FTP client in C language
* Use sockets and TCP in C language
* Understand service provided DNS and use it within a client program

The second part of the project, the goal was to configure and meticulously study a network. So, throughout the laboratory classes several experiences were realized about fundamental aspects of a network(IP, NAT, DNS, TCP, etc).
